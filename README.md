Business.txt
============

Business.txt is a file that local businesses upload to their website with their business information so all website providers can update it whenever something is changed.

How this works
--------------

1. Joe owns a restaurant in San Francisco. He is going to change the schedule.

2. He has two options:

    1. Without business.txt he would have to go to all the websites like Yelp and Foursquare and update the info one by one. Even after that, there would still be thousands of websites with the incorrect schedule.

    2. With business.txt he just updates the schedule on his website, and all the websites that support business.txt will update their info accordingly.
